Content Curation
================

Authors: Benjamin Bach, Calvin Mach

Scope
-----

This application is currently responsible for the creation of contents to
be used in "KA Lite", however not in relation to Khan Academy contents.

Furthermore, as exercises are seen as data, too, they are to be managed through
this application as well.

Refactoring plans
-----------------

There are other applications, namely `contentload` and `updates` that deal with
contents. If they are overhauled, consider moving them in here.
